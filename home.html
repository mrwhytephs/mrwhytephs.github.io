<H1>CHAMPIONS 2025</H1>

<p>Liverpool FC have officially clinched the 2024-25 Premier League title – winning England’s top division for the 20th time in history.

After a 5-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, the Reds now hold an unassailable lead at the summit and add 2024-25 to their list of championship successes.

Head coach Arne Slot has guided the team to glory at the first opportunity, with his debut season at the helm including 25 wins, seven draws and just two defeats in the top flight to date.

<br>
The triumph is the club’s second during the Premier League era, following that of 2019-20, and overall moves Liverpool level for the most English top-flight titles alongside Manchester United.

It also represents a 52nd major men’s honour in Reds history, with this the eighth secured during the past six years.</p>
